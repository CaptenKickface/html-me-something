                        The name Toby initially came from high school. In my freshman year,
                        I was hanging with some upper-classmen when they decided to come up 
                        with dumb nicknames. Things like Fred or Larry got passed around,
                        but my nickname became Toby.

                        While everyone else's nickname faded away after a week; mine stuck because of
                        a mini-series called "Roots". In it, there's an incredibly iconic scene that 
                        involves the use of the name Toby. In my school district this mini-series
                        was required material in middle school, so everyone found it fun to continue
                        calling me Toby. If you're curious, here's a link-
                        (fair warning: incredibly graphic)

                        <p>
                        At this point I had begun to introduce myself to people as Toby. After a bit,
                        I did more research into what Toby really meant. Toby, or Tobias, means "praise god"
                        in Hebrew. As a non-religious person that grew up with very catholic parents, the
                        irony was not lost on me and I felt compelled to continue going by Toby.

                        Around the same time I was changing my name, I also began training in martial 
                        arts; specifically Ninjutstu. While training, we also were taught Japanese to
                        learn the names of the moves. Coincidentally, Toby in Japanese translates to 
                        jump/agility (also construction worker but that ruins my narrative); the parkour 
                        parts of our training were what I enjoyed most.

                        At age 18 I developed a headache that would last for 3+ years. During that time I
                        mentally worked through finding peace through the pain and created a sort of
                        creed. This became a mantra for me to calm myself during excruciating moments.
                        Spontaneously, I ended the mantra with "I am Tobias Sol", which I plan to now
                        change my name to.

                            Lifeguarding gives you a lot of breaks to rest your eyes. This was a fun project
                            that got knocked over by a 7 year old.

                        Later in life I wanted to change my image. For most of it I had been
                        an aggressive person and decided to now become an easy-going presence at
                        work and at home. While working with kids at a daycare, I realized "Toby"
                        really counteracted my resting b**** face and kids had fun simply saying
                        my name. To be fair "Mr. Toby" sounds ridiculous.

                            I made this snowman with my dad. The snow was poor and picked up a lot of dirt,
                            so we named him Rusty the Snowman and gave him a block head.
